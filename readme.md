# COVID Vaccine Tweet Sentimental Analysis✨

📚 **Description**
=================

Welcome to Sentimental Analysis! This project is designed to creating a robust sentiment analysis model using three powerful transformer-based models: RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT. It's a crucial natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral.

🇱 **Prerequisites**
---------------------
Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Streamlit
- Transformers
- NumPy
- SciPy

🔧 **Installation**
-----------------
To get started with Sentimental Analysis, follow these installation steps:

1. You need to have `Python3` on your system. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's root `(root :: repo_name> ...)` follow the steps below:
- Windows:
```
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  
```

- Linux & MacOs:

```
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  
```

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol ; but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. <b>Create the Python's virtual environment</b> that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. <b>Activate the Python's virtual environment</b> so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. <b>Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager</b> to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. <b>Install the required libraries/packages</b> listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.
